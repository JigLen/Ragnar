What will you do today?

Dimitar 	-   Thinking about the db restructure eg new relationships, maybe think about
                breeaking base_data table up for better data access speeds. Research the meanings
                of the columns in base data and draw up a template for the separate base_data table
                based on what will be used most/least etc.

Sahar		-   User Story 5.

David		-   User Story 4.

Carl		-   Unify master with testing and all code from Sprint 0, so the project can move forward.

Ciaran		-   at the moment user specific pages can be accessed via url. Ciaran is going to
                restrict these to appropriate privilege levels.


 What issues do you have?
