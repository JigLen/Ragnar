What will you do today?

Dimitar 	-

Sahar		-   Continue

David		-   Continue

Carl		-   Continue on arquillian integration.

Ciaran		-   Switching to Carls task of file upload / persistence. File upload
                should be working , just need proper entity object creation and
                persistence. Also Excel -> Java -> DB rather than Excel -> CSV
                -> Java -> DB for speedup.
