Combine your new work back into master:

in branch development)$ git merge master
(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)
                                        // now you have an up to date working branch
git checkout master
git merge development (there won't be any conflicts now)
                                        // for when dev isn't dev anymore and you want it
                                        // on master


This might ask you to do a set-upstream command:

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master development


this sets your local git to track your development branch i think*
this will help the merge process
