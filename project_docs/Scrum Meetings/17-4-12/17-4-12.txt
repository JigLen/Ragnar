What did you do?

Dimitar     -   Work on bootstrap login.

Sahar       -   Researched graphing. Written HTML for the graphs (designed).

David       -   Implementing final User stories. Working(failing :) ) on arquillian

Carl        -   Refactor to named queries, to make code more readable. Try/catch on persist
                removes need for validation methods in Entity. Proper order and commenting
                on some classed to make user stories easier to find in code (needs further
                tidying).

Ciar√°n      -   Going at Sessions, didn't make much progress.

David		-   Looking at bootstrap login too. Communicate with dimitar about it. And
                Non login bootstrap. Will coordinate with ciaran on a design then branch
                and work on individual parts of it. Look into Sessions as well.

Carl		-   Setup windows laptop for dimitar's old page problem (Not needed in the
                end). Fix US 8 & 10 (only url methods). Continue code cleaning. Look into
                sessions. Push to master.
